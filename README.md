# inaSpeechSegmenter

inaSpeechSegmenter is a framework for speech segmentation in Python 3.
It provides methods for speech music segmentation allowing to split audio signal into homogenous zones of speech and music.
It provides methods for speaker gender segmentation allowing to split speech excerpts into men and women speech.

## Installation

inaSpeechSegmenter is a framework in python 3. It can be installed using the following procedure:


```bash
# clone git repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ina-foss/inaSpeechSegmenter.git
# create a python 3 virtual environement and activate it
$ virtualenv -p python3 inaSpeechSegEnv
$ source inaSpeechSegEnv/bin/activate
# install a backend for keras (tensorflow, theano, cntk...)
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu # if you wish GPU implementation (recommended)
$ pip install tensorflow # for a CPU implementation
# install framework and dependencies
$ cd inaSpeechSegmenter
$ python setup.py install
```
